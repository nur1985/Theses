%Appendices are written like the body of the paper using
%\verb+\chapter+.
%\LaTeX\ numbers them with capital letters.
%If there is only one appendix, 
%then use \verb+\oneappendix+ instead of \verb+\chapter+
%so that the table of contents is properly formatted.
%
%The MSU library requires that each appendix have a 
%separator page.  The following lines in 
%{\tt examplethesis.tex} achieve this.
%
%\newspacing{\singlespacing}\begin{verbatim}
%%MSU library requires title page for each appendix
%\renewcommand{\appendixname}{\vspace*{2.5in}Appendix} 
%%for appendix title page
%\oneappendix{An Example} %for a single appendix
%%\chapter{An Appendix Title} 
%%alternative for each of multiple appendices
%\newpage %end of appendix title page
%\input{exappendix} %content of appendix
%\end{verbatim}\newspacing{\defaultspacing}
%
%The \verb+\vspace*+ command provides 
%the proper layout of the title page.
%This example has only one appendix.  
%Therefore, the
%\verb+\oneappendix+ command is used.
%The \verb+\newpage+ command forces a page break
%after the title page.
%If you have multiple appendices, then
%use the \verb+\chapter+ command for each appendix
%instead of \verb+\oneappendix+,
%and put \verb+\newpage+ after each \verb+\chapter+ command.

\Section{Transparency with Respect to Hydrogen}%
\label{Transparency with respect to Hydrogen}
Transparency of kaon with respect to free-nucleon cross section for three kinematics for all the targets is shown in \Tableref{t_2}. We used hydrogen cross section as the free-nucleon cross section. The total uncertainty has been taken as the quadrature sum of the statistical and systematic uncertainty. The different targets are shown by different colors as: BLACK- $LD_2$, RED- carbon, GREEN- copper and BLUE- gold for three different kinematics ($Q^2$= 1.1, 2.2 and 3.0 $(\mathrm{GeV/c})^2$). In \figureref{transp1}, the inner bar shows the statistical uncertainty and outer bar shows the systematic uncertainty and total uncertainty as quadrature sum these two.
