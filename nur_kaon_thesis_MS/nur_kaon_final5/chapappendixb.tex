\Section{$\alpha$ Plot}
%\label{$\alpha$ plot}
We have shown $\alpha$ for three kinematic settings in \Tableref{alpha1} plotted in BLUE in \figureref{alpha} with respect to hydrogen target. The available $\alpha$ values from proton and pion analysis have been shown in RED and GREEN, respectively, for comparison. We considered only the statistical uncertainties which are shown by closed vertical lines. The experimental $\alpha$ values from the processes other than electro-production are shown by the horizontal band in \figureref{alpha}. The width of the band represents statistical uncertainty.

\Section{Comparison of Yields for Data with SIMC}
We already discussed in section \ref{Comparison of Data with SIMC Yields} about the dependency of the cross section upon four variables: $Q^2$, $W$, $t$ and $\phi_{pq}$, where $Q^2$ is four-momentum transferred square, $W$ is the center of mass energy, $t$ is momentum transfer, and $\phi_{pq}$ is  the angle between the scattering and reaction planes. In this appendix, we are showing comparison of SIMC and data yields for missing mass, $W$, $t$ and $\phi_{pq}$ in the \figureref{missmass2}, \figureref{com_plot_w_2}, \figureref{com_plot_t_2} and \figureref{com_plot_phi_2}, respectively. We have already shown the comparison for $Q^2$ in section \ref{Comparison of Data with SIMC Yields}.

\Section{Iteration}
We have done the iteration on the data to verify our transparency results. As the statistics was very low, we did not expect a large variation in the results. We fitted data for the variables $Q^2$, $W$ and t for $\Lambda$ and $\Sigma$ production as shown in \figureref{fitfunction_kin2_1}, \figureref{fitfunction_kin2_2} and \figureref{fitfunction_kin2_3}, respectively. These fit functions were used to generate the SIMC ntuples. New ntuples were used again for extraction of transparency to check the stability of the yields. This process was repeated doing a second iteration. After the iteration, we did not get any reasonable change in the yields and hence results presented in this thesis are without considering any iteration.
