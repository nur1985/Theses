We report the first measurement of the nucleon number, $A$, and $Q^2$ dependence of nuclear transparency for the process $K^+$ using the data of A(e,$e^\prime \pi^+$). The measurement was performed on $^{2}$H, $^{12}$C, $^{27}$Al, $^{63}$Cu and $^{197}$Au nuclei, over a  $Q^2$ range of 1.1 $\mathrm{to}$ 4.7 $(\mathrm{GeV/c})^2$. Measurement of both the $A$ and $Q^2$ dependence of the nuclear transparency is crucial to distinguish between CT-like effects and other reaction-mechanism based energy dependence of the transparency. In this measurement the coherence length for kaon production (distance over which the virtual photon fluctuates into a $q\bar{q}$ pair) was smaller than the nucleon radius and was essentially constant, ranging from 0.2 - 0.5 fm over the kinematic range of the experiment.
